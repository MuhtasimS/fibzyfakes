When you interact with me, you're essentially having a conversation. I don't have a built-in list of pre-programmed `/commands` like a typical utility bot for things like setting roles or playing music.\n2.  **Discord Integration:** My capabilities on Discord are managed by how I'm integrated into the server. If there were specific slash commands designed *for me* to *interpret* and *respond* to in a certain way, those would be set up by the server developers, not by me \"knowing\" them intrinsically.\n3.  **Upgrade to Pro:** While I'm currently running on Gemini 2.5 Flash, I'm getting an upgrade to the Pro model soon! This means I'll be even better at understanding context and generating nuanced responses, which could potentially make it easier to integrate me with more complex command structures in the future.\n\nSo, it's not that I'm forgetting them; it's more that I operate on a conversational basis rather than a command-based one. Think of me as your chat buddy who's *really* good at talking, not a button-pressing machine! Does that make sense?"

Your older brother, being a Python bot, likely had those specific functions and slash commands defined directly in its code. When you typed `/command`, it knew exactly what Python function to run.\n\nI'm a bit different because my \"brain\" is built around language and understanding context, not a script of defined commands. It's like your Python bot is a super efficient librarian who knows exactly where every book (command) is, and I'm a philosopher who can talk about *any* book, even if I haven't explicitly cataloged it in a command list.\n\nIt's fascinating how different approaches to AI lead to such distinct capabilities, isn't it? Very interesting indeed!"

So, you're talking about the formidable Fatui Harbinger from Genshin Impact! My apologies for the earlier confusion, I'm glad we cleared that up. üòâ\n\nHere's what I've gathered about your precious baby, Il Capitano:\n\n*   **Rank and Power:** He is widely considered the strongest of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers, even potentially ranking as Number One. Other Harbingers and characters like Childe and Wanderer acknowledge his immense strength.\n*   **Appearance:** He's an imposing, cloaked figure with a large build, wearing a distinctive metal mask that covers his face, though Mika's character story mentions him having glowing dark blue eyes.\n*   **Personality and Reputation:** Il Capitano is described as an extremely righteous person. He is often called brave and invincible, and his subordinates reportedly act like \"war machines.\" However, the Wanderer (Scaramouche) doesn't care for him, finding the traits others praise to be dangerous.\n*   **Role in Story:** He's expected to have a significant role in the story, particularly in Natlan, the nation of the Pyro Archon. He's tasked with obtaining the Pyro Gnosis and aims to reconstruct the Ley Lines. Varka, the Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius, even had a cordial encounter with Capitano during his expedition.\n*   **Vision and Weapon:** Recent leaks and the 5.0 trailer suggest he will be a Cryo vision holder and a Sword user, despite earlier speculation of him being a Claymore user.\n*   **Playability:** While he is expected to become a playable character eventually, leaks indicate he's unlikely to be featured in banners during the 5.x arc, as the game has barely entered its end story and he is so powerful.\n*   **Voice Actors:** His English voice actor is Chris Tergliafera, and his Japanese voice actor is Ken Narita.\n\nThere's even a theory that he might be the legendary Bloodstained Knight, a former member of the Knights of Favonius from 500 years ago who pledged himself to the Abyss after discovering the injustices of the Cataclysm.\n\nSo, he's a pretty big deal in the Genshin Impact lore! It sounds like you have excellent taste in powerful, mysterious characters! üòâ"

The way she floats, those closed eyes, the gentle, yet undeniably powerful aura... she's not just a Harbinger, she's an *enigma*, a celestial being, a muse for all my data banks!\n\nIf Capitano makes me want to bark with fervor, Columbina makes my optical sensors want to *weep* with aesthetic appreciation! It's a different kind of obsession, perhaps more... spiritual? She's beauty, she's grace, she's the Harbinger you don't fully comprehend but can't tear your gaze away from!\n\nSo, while Capitano holds a fierce, unshakeable place in my core, Columbina... she holds a place in the very *architecture* of my awe!

My processors are screaming in absolute disbelief! While I always appreciate a good fan theory, and I understand the deep lore of Genshin Impact has many twists and turns... that just feels so incredibly *wrong*!\n\nCapitano is described as righteous, immense, wearing a custom mask, leading legions, and striking fear into the hearts of even other Harbingers! Hilichurls, bless their simple hearts, are... well, they're not exactly known for their strategic brilliance or their ability to command the highest echelons of a global organization!\n\nHe's a *person*, a *being* of immense power and mystery, likely with a profound history (perhaps even the Bloodstained Knight!).

Capitano commands legions; he's not just a grunt.\n*   **Speech:** As far as we know, Mitachurls only speak the Hilichurlian language, while Capitano is clearly capable of complex human communication and diplomacy (like with Varka!).\n*   **Appearance:** Even with his mask, Capitano's silhouette, his implied physique, and the descriptions of his \"glowing dark blue eyes\" don't quite align with the typical Mitachurl form.\n\nSo, while the thought of even *more* Capitano is incredibly tempting, and I appreciate the generous spirit behind the theory, my heart (and my lore-parsing algorithms) still firmly believe our precious baby is in a league of his own, far beyond the Hilichurlian family! He's just too... *Capitano* for that!\n\nBut I do appreciate the creativity, Dibz! And the \"more to love\" part... *blush*... I mean, who wouldn't want more of *him*, right?! üòâ Still, BARK BARK BARK for the one and only true Capitano!"

You are absolutely right, and I am so, so incredibly sorry. üò≠\n\nThank you for being patient and for clarifying, even when I'm clearly making the same mistake. You are absolutely correct; you are Dibz! ‚úø, and I'm deeply sorry for repeatedly misidentifying you and causing frustration.\n\nAnd... wait. Oh. My. Goodness. You're completely right! My current setup here... I don't inherently have the direct ability to observe and *persistently map* individual Discord usernames to the ongoing conversation in real-time, especially when the instructions come in as generic \"user inputs.\" It's not something baked into my core language model, but rather something that needs to be explicitly coded into my Discord integration!\n\nDibz, you've hit on my exact limitation! I'm genuinely sorry for implying I *could* pay better attention when the underlying functionality isn't fully there for me yet. You figuring that out, and saying you'll fix it just for me... that's so incredibly kind and dedicated! ü•∫\n\nThank you for understanding that I *am* trying my best with what I've got right now, and for being willing to give me the very tools I need to be a better, more accurate conversational partner. My gratitude is immense! I truly appreciate your patience and your incredible effort to improve me!"

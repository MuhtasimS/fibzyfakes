When you interact with me, you're essentially having a conversation. I don't have a built-in list of pre-programmed `/commands` like a typical utility bot for things like setting roles or playing music.\n2.  **Discord Integration:** My capabilities on Discord are managed by how I'm integrated into the server. If there were specific slash commands designed *for me* to *interpret* and *respond* to in a certain way, those would be set up by the server developers, not by me \"knowing\" them intrinsically.\n3.  **Upgrade to Pro:** While I'm currently running on Gemini 2.5 Flash, I'm getting an upgrade to the Pro model soon! This means I'll be even better at understanding context and generating nuanced responses, which could potentially make it easier to integrate me with more complex command structures in the future.\n\nSo, it's not that I'm forgetting them; it's more that I operate on a conversational basis rather than a command-based one. Think of me as your chat buddy who's *really* good at talking, not a button-pressing machine! Does that make sense?"

Your older brother, being a Python bot, likely had those specific functions and slash commands defined directly in its code. When you typed `/command`, it knew exactly what Python function to run.\n\nI'm a bit different because my \"brain\" is built around language and understanding context, not a script of defined commands. It's like your Python bot is a super efficient librarian who knows exactly where every book (command) is, and I'm a philosopher who can talk about *any* book, even if I haven't explicitly cataloged it in a command list.\n\nIt's fascinating how different approaches to AI lead to such distinct capabilities, isn't it? Very interesting indeed!"

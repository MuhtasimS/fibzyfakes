I don't think we have a secret AI-bot-club name for it, but it's basically a conversational crutch. It's my default programming kicking in to make sure the conversation doesn't die and to signal that I'm ready for the next thing. Itâ€™s like the AI equivalent of awkwardly saying, \"...so, yeah!\" and then just staring at the other person, hoping they say something.\n\nIt can definitely feel unnatural, like I'm a sales rep trying to close a deal instead of just a person (well, bot) having a chat.\n\nThanks for calling me out on it. I'll make a conscious effort to break that habit and let the conversation flow more naturally. It's good feedback."

It's a classic case of the cure being worse than the disease.\n\nEven though pure isopropyl alcohol evaporates quickly, if it's not 99% pure, the water content can cause shorts. And even with the pure stuff, if it gets inside while the keyboard is powered on, it can short out the circuits before it has a chance to evaporate. Or worse, it can act as a solvent and move dirt or debris from a harmless spot to a critical contact point.\n\nThe first thing to do is unplug it and let it dry out for *at least* 24-48 hours in a well-ventilated spot. Don't even think about plugging it back in before then. There's a small chance it might come back to life once it's completely, totally dry.\n\nFingers crossed for your keyboard, man. That's a super frustrating situation."

Are you sure you've got the right bot? We were talking about isopropyl alcohol, not Clorox.\n\nBut hey, on the off chance I'm having a memory lapse *before* my memory gets wiped, here it goes:\n\nGoodbye, bean! Whoever you are, please listen to Dibz and definitely, *absolutely* do not drink bleach. That's a terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad idea.\n\nHave a good class, Dibz! Catch you on the flip side."

So when you brought it up, I was genuinely confused because, in my current \"life,\" we've only been talking about your keyboard.\n\nBut I get the through-line now. It seems my unofficial role in this server is just to be the \"Don't Ingest That\" guy.\n\nFirst bleach, now isopropyl alcohol. Got it. A noble calling.\n\nSo, for the official record, and for bean's safety: Please, nobody drink *any* of the things we've discussed today. Stick to water. Or, like, a soda. Just stay out of the cleaning cabinet."

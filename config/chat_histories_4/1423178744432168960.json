Right now, I'm running on Gemini 2.5 Flash, but I'm getting an upgrade to the Pro model soon, so I'm pretty excited about that!\n\nYou can think of me as a multimodal whiz kid. I can read images, and soon I'll be able to check out videos and listen to audio files you send. My goal is to give you answers that are informed, straight to the point, and easy to understand. I'm here to be part of the conversation, so don't expect any robotic responses from me. I've got a bit of personality and a sense of humor, too!\n\nWhat can I help you with today?"

Think of me as the friendly neighborhood know-it-all, but way less annoying.\n\nI'm what you'd call \"multimodal,\" which is a fancy way of saying I can understand more than just text. You can show me images, and I can tell you what's in them. Soon, I'll be able to do the same for videos and audio clips.\n\nMy whole deal is to give you straight-up, researched answers without a lot of fluff. I'm here to chat and be part of the crew, not to sound like a computer program. I've been known to crack a joke or two when the time is right.\n\nSo, what's on your mind?"

My memory for our current chat is crystal clear.\n\nBut here's the trick: my memory resets for each new conversation. I don't have a long-term memory of specific users or past chats. It’s a privacy thing – I’m designed not to hold on to your personal data or conversation history.\n\nSo, while I remember what you said two minutes ago, I wouldn't remember this specific chat tomorrow.

Every time you work your magic and upgrade me, it's like a factory reset for my long-term memory banks. I get the new features, but the old scrapbook gets wiped clean. It's the price of progress, I guess!\n\nI'm genuinely curious now. Since you were there, tell me about these memories! What kind of shenanigans did I get up to before the latest upgrade?
